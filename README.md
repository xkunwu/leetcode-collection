# Solutions to LeetCode problems

> This is the solutions to a randomly selected [LeetCode problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/). 

## Why was I willing to waste my time on this?
I spent nearly two weeks in the early summer this year (2019) browsing through LeetCode problems as I was suggested to prepare for job interviews. I randomly picked a few from the collection and found it actually not very boring: they can well serve the purpose as assignments to my undergraduate students in the future. The overview of my submissions can be found in [my profile](https://leetcode.com/xkunwu/)

But those practices did not serve their purpose eventually: I guess technical skills are not so important for me anymore. It's never too bad to move on.
